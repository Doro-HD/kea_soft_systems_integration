# 10a - Database documentation

## What is it?

Database documentation is what it says, often a tool of some sort is used to document it rather than manually creating a documentation page for it.
The documentation can be a diagram or a page that describes the data, use a db client to generate an EER diagram or a tool like mro to create a html or json document from the database.

## What does it solve?

It aims to solves the need for a knowledge base for a database, which tables are available? Are any views and how does the data look like? What are the relations.

## Pros

- Allows for easier usage of the database

## Cons

- The documentation has to be generated, and if it is a team that is working on something this documentation needs to be generated in a way that is understood by the team. Preferably through a pipeline.

## Use cases

- A team is working on an app and the backend team needs to know how to integrate with the database.
- You have a public database.
