They facilitate the communication between user and bank. And in the case of stribe they also offer features that makes it more easy to keep track of products, prices and customers.

## Pros

- Allows for an easier payment integration, on a global scale.
- Provides extra features.

## Cons

- Can stil be complex to setup properly. Contries like Denmark have a lot of security features on top of payment.
- A great deal of trust needs to be given to this type of provider.

## Use cases

- Startup companies, they have significantly less resources to handle this kind of problem. A payment provider would therefore be a good solution.
- In generel a payment provider can be great if you want to focus on features rather than integration with banks as that is very complex. Espcially great for a webshop.
