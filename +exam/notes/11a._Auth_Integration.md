# 11a - Auth integration

## What is it?

It is an integration with an auth provider, an existing service that allows users to authenticate through them. Google, Microsoft, Apple, Discord and many other services offer authentication through them.

## What does it solve?

### User

For the user an auth provider makes it easier for them to sign up to new services, that way they dont have to create a new password. People generelly create bad passwords so it also provides "security" in the sense that people hopefully have a strong password with their chosen provider. Personally I prefer password managers.

### Provider

For the provider it allows them to make themselves more known, and they can track which services their users are using.

## Pros

- Ease of use for the user.
- Less bad passwords from the user.
- More data for the provider.
- More recognition for the provider if used.
- Provides a standard for handling security

## Cons

- The user can be monitored by their provider.
- Eventually everyone will just use Google
- User authenticated through a provider that is experiencing downtime will be affected by it on the services using that provider.
- Vendor lock in, if the provider now wants money for it

## Use cases

- Websites that cater to a specific group where it would assume they have a specific account, like discord for gamers or github for programmers.
