# 08a - WebRTC

## What is it?

WebRTC is an peer to peer realtime communication protocol, it is used for video/audio sharing.

To accomplish this one client generates an SDP object (Session Description Protocol), this offer is then sent to the other client which has to generate an SDP answer object and send that back to the client that generated the offer. When the answer has been accepted a connection has been established between the clients.

Not all clients allow this form of communication and NAT's and firewalls can pose a problem for direct connectinos. To solve this a technique known as ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) is used. ICE works by sending a list of possible IP addresses along with ports. To find these addresses and ports a STUN/TURN server is used. A lot of free STUN/TURN server exists, for example googles.

## What does it solve?

It allows for a somewhat easy integration between clients and is often used for chat application that rely on video and or audio.

## Pros

- Free and open source.
- Allows for a non centralized peer to peer connection with low latency.
- Most modern browsers supports this protocol.
- Built in encryption.

## Cons

- Quite complex to setup. Not a lot of libraries that provides this features.
- Scalability is not always easy as peer to peer does not scale that well.
- Older systems has limited support.

## Use cases

A voice and video client, similar to discord.
