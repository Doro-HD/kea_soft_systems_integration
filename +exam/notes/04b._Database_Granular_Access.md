# 04b - Database granular access

## What is it?

Granular acces in a database context, is the ability to restrict data on the most granular level for a given database.

## What does it solve?

It solves the problem whereing a user should only be allowed to read and write to very specific data.

## Pros

- Better data security, an user is restricted to the data they need.

## Cons

- Can be complex and hard to achive, read access in a SQL database on a granular level was quite hard...
- The extra security layers can generate overhead on the database.

## Use cases

A database that has sensitive information where some users are allowed to view specific parts of that information.
