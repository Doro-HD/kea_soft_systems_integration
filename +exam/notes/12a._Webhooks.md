# 12a - Webhooks

## What is it?

A webhook is simply a stored url that is called upon, often in event based systems. Think of a fisherman sending out a hook and waiting for a fish to bite.

For example, Github allows users to store webhooks on their service when specific events happen. Like when a pull request is created, merged, closed etc.

## What does it solve?

It tries to solve a similar problem to that of short/long pooling/SSE. How does the client get a realtime status from the server?

## Pros

- In contrast to the earlier mentioned solutions for realtime statuses, webhooks are low cost as it is just a stored url, and it is very easy to set up.

## Cons

- One way connection, insuficient if a more complex solution is needed.
- Lacking in complexity:
  - Is a simple http request, so additional features like retries or failed requests loggin needs to be implemented.

## Use cases

Webhook are excelent for one way status updates. Imagine a discord or slack server that recieves updates from the dev teams github repo. Could also be updates from payments services like stribe.
