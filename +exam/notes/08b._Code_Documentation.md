# 08b - Code documentation

## What is it?

Code documentation is having a process for how to document your code, forexample. JSDoc.

## What does it solve?

It solves the problem that arises from code that is not easy to understand or when the one responsible for a piece of code has not touched it in a long time.
Code can be self documenting to an extendt. But documentation can make the difference between having to spend 5-10 understanding something, rather than reading a comment in less than 10 seconds and know what the function does.

## Pros

- Allows for easier onboarding of new developers and when one needs to understand what they wrote six months ago.

## Cons

- Overhead, it takes time to create the documentation and it can clutter the file.
- The documentation needs to be written in a way that is understandable for others.

## Use case

A large and dynamic team will draw great strength from a documented code base. As will a startup that has many interns comming and going.
