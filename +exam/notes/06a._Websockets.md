# 06a - Websockets

## What is it?

Websocket is a real time communication protocol, a full duplex, bi directional connection.

## What does it solve?

It allows for situations where the client and server needs to communicate with each other in realtime, situations where SSE is not always enough.

## Pros

- A realtime protocol that is bi directional.
- Relatively easy to set up.
- Its better than short polling.
- low latency.

## Cons

- As it is a constantly open connection it is a more demanding protocol than http.
- Bad caching functionality.
- Can be hard to scale due to load balancing.

## Use cases

For applications that need bi directional communication in real time. Chat apps are a good example. Also apps that rely on constant teamwork, like google dox.

# Learning goals

## Understands the pros and cons of SSE and can compare it to Websockets.

SSE is unidirectional from server to client and it still uses http(s). Websockets is full duplex bi-directional, from client to server and server to client.

## Can explain how WebSocket works.

Uses the websocket protocol which allows for real time bi-directional communication between server and client
