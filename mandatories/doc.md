- # Documentation
	- ## Connect
		- For my database I chose postgres so be sure to install postgresql so that you can run the cli tool used in this documentation
		- For this exercise I will be providing you with two db users. see username below, for easy use both of their passwords are 'si-o4b'
			- lasse
			- troels
		- As I use [Pinggy](https://pinggy.io), the free tier only allow for random subdomains, I will be providing the host and port name to you upon request instead of in this documentation
		- To connect to the db instance via my TCP tunnel, use the following command, replace the placeholder with the information provided upon your request
			-
			  ```
			  psql -h <host> -p <port> -U <lasse|troels> -d si-04b
			  ```
